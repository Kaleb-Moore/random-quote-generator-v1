# Random Quote Generator

This is a random quote generator for the FSJS Techdegree from Treehouse.
The goal was to create an array that had multiple objects literals and be able to access them and display them randomly.
Along with that, it also changes the background color each time the button is pressed and has a timer that automatically changes the quote after 20 seconds.
